    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>As i have said in the index page this project is mostly just learning and making use of it..</p>
    <p>I am a developer and a couple years ago i started learning luau but i have changed to start learning software development.</p>
    <p>I have started learning GDscript because its a easier programming language but i have then switched to python.</p>
    <p>and now i am learning html coding as i thought it would come in handy for posting my own work on very own website.</p>
    <p>My goal is to learn as much as i can and make a career out of it.</p>
    <p>Now it might kinda sound stupid learning every possible language there is and not focusing on one main thing.</p>
    <p>But i still dont really know for what and why i should learn a specific language which is why im just looking around.</p>
    <p>But i am sure that i will find something that i will like and stick to it.</p>
