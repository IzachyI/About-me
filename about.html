        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>As I have said on the index page, this project is mostly just learning and making use of it.</p>
        <p>I am a developer, and a couple of years ago I started learning Luau, but I have since switched to learning software development.</p>
        <p>I started learning GDScript because it's an easier programming language, but I then switched to Python.</p>
        <p>Now I am learning HTML coding as I thought it would come in handy for posting my own work on my very own website.</p>
        <p>My goal is to learn as much as I can and make a career out of it.</p>
        <p>It might sound a bit scattered, learning every possible language and not focusing on one main thing.</p>
        <p>But I still don’t really know what and why I should learn a specific language, which is why I’m just exploring.</p>
        <p>However, I am sure that I will find something I like and stick to it.</p>
